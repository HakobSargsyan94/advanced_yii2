I use the Yii2 basic .

For use project you need to do git clone after that run the composer update .

Required php 7.4 >= , MySQL 10.*

I used the OpenServer . 

For get token you need to use in your console "php yii get-token" after than you must fill the username and password 

For registration you must sigh-up in project

Use token  in api for example Postman Api key authorization

for insert json in Database you must request GET/POST to 

GET => <your_domain>/frontend/insert?<json>

POST => <your_domain>/frontend/insert in body raw data (json)

i sent your HR postman api documentation
